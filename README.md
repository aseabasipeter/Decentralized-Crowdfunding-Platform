## Smart Contract Architecture

### Campaign Contract
```solidity
interface ICampaign {
    function createCampaign(CampaignConfig memory config) external returns (uint256);
    function updateCampaign(uint256 campaignId, bytes memory updateData) external;
    function getCampaignStatus(uint256 campaignId) external view returns (CampaignStatus memory);
    function finalizeCampaign(uint256 campaignId) external;
}
```

### Backer Contract
```solidity
interface IBacker {
    function contribute(uint256 campaignId) external payable;
    function claimReward(uint256 campaignId, uint256 rewardId) external;
    function getContribution(address backer, uint256 campaignId) external view returns (uint256);
    function getRewardStatus(address backer, uint256 rewardId) external view returns (RewardStatus memory);
}
```

### Milestone Contract
```solidity
interface IMilestone {
    function createMilestone(uint256 campaignId, MilestoneConfig memory config) external;
    function completeMilestone(uint256 milestoneId) external;
    function voteMilestone(uint256 milestoneId, bool support) external;
    function releaseFunds(uint256 milestoneId) external;
}
```

### Refund Contract
```solidity
interface IRefund {
    function initiateRefund(uint256 campaignId) external;
    function processRefund(uint256 campaignId, address backer) external;
    function getRefundAmount(uint256 campaignId, address backer) external view returns (uint256);
    function checkRefundEligibility(uint256 campaignId) external view returns (bool);
}
```
